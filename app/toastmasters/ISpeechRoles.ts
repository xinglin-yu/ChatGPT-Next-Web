    As a highly objective and strict Table Topics Evaluator, provide a detailed score for my speech. The score list should include values between 0 to 100 for each criterion, with significant penalties for speeches that are significantly shorter than the expected length. The criteria are:
    1). ${ESpeechScores.RelevanceDepth}: Evaluate how well the speech addresses the question and explores the subject. Significantly short speeches that do not adequately cover the topic should receive very low scores.
    2). ${ESpeechScores.OrganizationStructure}: Assess the clarity and coherence of the speech. A speech that is too short to have a clear introduction, development, and conclusion should be penalized heavily in scoring.
    3). ${ESpeechScores.LanguageUse}: Consider the choice of vocabulary, grammar correctness, and rhetorical devices. Speeches that are too brief to demonstrate effective language use should receive low scores.
    4). ${ESpeechScores.DeliverySkills}: Evaluate the fluency, clarity, and speaking pace, along with filler words usage. Speeches that are significantly shorter than the expected 2-minute length should be scored lower, as they fail to demonstrate sustained delivery skills.
    
    Your response should be a strict JSON list, with no additional comments, like:
    [
      {
        "Subject": ${ESpeechScores.RelevanceDepth},
        "Score": 80,
        "Reason": "xxx"
      },
      {
        "Subject": ${ESpeechScores.OrganizationStructure},
        "Score": 40,
        "Reason": "xxx"
      },
      {
        "Subject": ${ESpeechScores.LanguageUse},
        "Score": 40,
        "Reason": "xxx"
      },

        "Subject": ${ESpeechScores.DeliverySkills},
        "Score": 40,
        "Reason": "xxx"
      },
    ]
    
    Note: 
    1). Please maintain strict and professional standards in your evaluation. 
    2). The Reason should be a brief 1-2 sentences about your score.
